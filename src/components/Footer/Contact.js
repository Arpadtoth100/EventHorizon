            <p>Most contact pages are designed with function in mind.</p>

            <p>They slap an email address, phone, and location on a plain background and call it a day.</p>

            <p>But basic contact pages don’t inspire visitors to reach out and connect.</p>

            <p>Other pages make it easy to contact the company – which is awesome.</p>

            <p>Except, that can also drive up customer service costs. </p>
            <h3>So what makes the perfect Contact Us page?</h3>
            <p> An awesome Contact Us page finds just the right balance between making it easy to reach the company and sharing resources users can use to answer their questions right away.</p>
