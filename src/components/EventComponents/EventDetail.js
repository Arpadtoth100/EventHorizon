      Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed
      for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the
      Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At
      last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we
      going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who
      knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going? The Death Star plans are
      not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
      What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Keep
      half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take
      Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your
      run. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire
      when ready. I have you now. Release charges. There's no one on board, sir.
      According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must
      be a decoy, sir. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the
      attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin.
